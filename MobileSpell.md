# Mobile keyboard spell checker enhancements

# Deliverables

## Targeted features

* spell checking for the mobile keyboards (iOS and Android) using the [Rust hfst-ospell library](https://github.com/bbqsrc/hfst-ospell-rs)
* speller files updated via a PÃ¡hkat repository
* generate speller error model for nearby key hits based on keyboard layout
* automatically maintained user dictionary:
    * unknowns not corrected into a candidate list
    * unknowns left uncorrected a second time stored in user dictionary, and suggested prior to anything else for similar input
    * user dictionary should be visible and editable in dictionary app, including option to upload to Divvun for inclusion of new words (that would also require storing one word before and after, or the two preceding words, to give a minimum of context for the use of the word - this can also help us build a trigram of word usage for word prediction)
