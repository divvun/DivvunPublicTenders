# Tables of requirements

The requirements in the table of requirements form the basis for the Supplier’s description of its solution specification, cf. Bilag 2. The Supplier must give an extensive description of all requirements so that the Parties will have a common understanding of what is to be delivered, or which can give the Buyer alternative perspectives to the requirements expressed in the Buyer’s requirements specification.

The different requirements have different priority.

1. **Priority A** = 	Absolute requirements that must be fulfilled. Tenders that do not fulfil all the absolute requirements will be rejected.  
1. **Priority B** = 	Important requirements that should be fulfilled, but it is not an absolute requirement. Answers will be of great importance for the evaluation of the tender. The requirements are weighted higher than C-requirements.
1. **Priority C** = 	Conditional requirements that should be fulfilled, but it is not an absolute requirement. Answers will be of importance for the evaluation of the tender. The requirements are weighted lower than B-requirements.

When filling out the tables of requirements the Supplier shall mark an (X) in the column for yes, partly or no under “the Supplier’s fulfilment”. Reference to relevant documentation and any additional comments shall be made in the column “Comment”. It is reminded that it is the duty of the Supplier to document that it fulfils the set requirements. Any missing documentation will result in the requirement being considered as not fulfilled.

There is one table each for Contract Area 1 and Contract Area 2.
