# Advanced mobile keyboard spell checker enhancements

This subproject builds on the work done for [basic speller support](MobileSpell.md) in mobile keyboards, but depends on the [iOS keyboard rewrite](iOSKeyboardRewrite.md). The goal is to deliver a more advanced speller, with universal language support, and automatic download and updates of speller dictionaries.

# Deliverables

## Targeted features

* speller files updated via a PÃ¡hkat repository; no speller files are included at build time
* automatically maintained user dictionary:
    * user dictionary should be visible and editable in dictionary app, including option to upload to Divvun for inclusion of new words (that would also require storing one word before and after, or the two preceding words, to give a minimum of context for the use of the word - this can also help us build a trigram of word usage for word prediction)

## Supported languages

Any language that can be identified with a [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) code.

## Compatibility requirements

* iOS 9+
* Android 5+

## Acceptance requirements

Before delivery of final version:

* user documentation
* passing all defined tests
* all code in Github

# Tender

## Tender requirements

* solid Rust programming experience
* solid iOS programming experience
* solid Android programming experience

**solid** = reference to at least five independent projects involving the language or platform in question.

## Subproject selection criteria

* experience with similar work
