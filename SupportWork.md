In addition, all new code developed as part of the tender, beyond the maintenance and support work specified as part of the original development work, falls under this project after delivery, acceptance and project-specific maintenance and support.

This project also covers new feature requests for all existing code as well as newly developed code after completion. And finally, new Divvun code repositories can be added as need be.
